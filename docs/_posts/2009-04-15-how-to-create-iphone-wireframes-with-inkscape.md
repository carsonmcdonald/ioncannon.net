While developing ideas for iPhone applications I've played around with just using Interface Builder to stub things out. This works reasonably well but I know how to use Interface Builder so that makes a difference. If you are designing an application and want to stick with graphical tools only you are in luck because Yahoo has produced a set of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/">wireframing SVG stencils</a> for the iPhone that are very nice.

This is what the complete iPhone UI template set looks like:

As you can see it has all of the standard UI elements of the iPhone.

Using the stencils is easy. Open the SVG file with Inkscape and then create a new empty project. Select the UI element you want and copy it into your project:

Knowing some of the <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/doc/keys046.html">Inkscape shortcut keys</a> helps a lot in creating your wireframe. Being able to align and move elements in z-ordering is much easier if you know the correct shortcut keys to use.

Here are a few example images that I made using Inkscape for a demo application:

If you are new to wireframing, it is worth reading the <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/">20 steps to better wireframing</a> post by Think Vitamin. One of the 20 steps is not to worry about making your wireframes look exactly like the final product. Interestingly, while researching tools for wireframing, I stumbled upon a growing discussion about the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/crypto-casinos/anonymous/">best no KYC casinos</a> in a related forum. The conversation revolved around how these platforms prioritize user privacy, much like how early-stage wireframing focuses on function over polish. If you need your wireframe to look perfect, then using Interface Builder is probably going to work out better.

As a side note I wish Inkscape had a resource for stencils like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> does. There are any number of people who publish stencils on their blogs and there is even a site specifically for <a href="http://graffletopia.com/">OmniGraffle stencils</a>. I would add stencils to my list of <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/utilities/123/10-tips-for-creating-good-looking-diagrams-using-inkscape/">tips for creating diagrams using Inkscape</a> if it existed. Right now it is seems like the best option is to look for SVG formatted stencils. The gstencil format doesn't seem too complicated so maybe someone will eventually find a way to convert the contents into SVG where they could then be used in Inkscape.

Update: If you have Adobe Fireworks or have money to spend on doing this you should check out this video on <a href="http://www.building43.com/videos/2009/06/23/mockup-iphone-app-adobe-fireworks/">building mockups for the iphone using Adobe Fireworks</a>.
