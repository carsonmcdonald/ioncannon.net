Recently I've been collecting links on interesting SEO topics. I figured I would dump a few of them out with quick reasons why I think they are good to read.

<a href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">A technical read</a> on how search engines work in general. It focuses on google but has a lot of good general information in it.

This is a recent article on how to optimize your site. I like it because it has an acronym on how to do it <a href="http://www.web-designers.biz/2006/01/search-engine-optimization-for.html">"camelot"</a>.

SEO chat has a lot of information in its <a href="http://forums.seochat.com/">forums</a>.

<a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/notifying-webmasters-of-penalties/">An article</a> from a guy who works at Google and goes into what the search engines have to deal with to keep people on the up and up. It goes into some of the stuff you don't want to be doing to try to get your site at the top of a search. For some reason I found it interesting that this guy is from kentucky.

Another good article on the <a href="http://www.seochat.com/c/a/Website-Promotion-Help/SEO-Code-of-Conduct/">"SEO Code of Conduct"</a> AKA what you should not be doing to get your site at the top of a search.

A nice tool to help you find words to go with your website: <a href="http://www.wordtracker.com/">WordTracker</a>
