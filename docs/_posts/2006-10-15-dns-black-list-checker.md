At work we have been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL">DNS Black Lists</a> for a long time to deny spam coming into our email systems. There are a number of places you can check to see if you are on one of these lists but I figured I would write my own web 2.0 version. So here it is my own <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/dnsbl/">DNSBL checker</a>. I believe it has most of the major lists on it but if I find more I'll add them. I'm also going to try to post more about how it is all put together.
