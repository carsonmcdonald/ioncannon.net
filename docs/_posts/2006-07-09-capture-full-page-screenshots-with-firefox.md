  content: "[...] After my post about capturing full page screenshots with firefox
    I started wondering if there was a way to do screencasts using Linux. It just
    so happens that you can. There are a couple different options if you want a pure
    movie of your desktop but I was more interested in a flash version. I found what
    I was looking for with this tutorial on how to record videos of your desktop that
    uses vnc2swf. [...]"

Ever wanted to capture the entire page you are viewing in firefox instead of just what is shown on your screen? Ever need to do that from a command line? Here are two extensions that let you do just that.

<h2>Page Saver</h2>

The first extension is called <a href="http://pearlcrescent.com/products/pagesaver/">Page Saver</a> and comes in two versions. The pro version you have to pay for but the free version does a good job all by itself. Here is an example of a fullpage screenshot: 

<img src="/assets/img/news.com.page.saveer.jpg"/>

Here is an example of a normal screenshot: 

<img src="/assets/img/news.com.page.saveer.visible.jpg"/>

I think from a technical standpoint this extension is the better of the two. It seems to perform a little better and doesn't suffer from any obvious bugs. The pro version doesn't offer a lot great extras but if you want to save to an FTP/HTTP server or directly to your clipboard then you will probably want to pay for it.

<h2>ScreenGrab</h2>

The second extension is <a href="http://andy.5263.org/?page_id=5">ScreenGrab</a>. This is a completely free screen capture extension but doesn't have as many features as Page Saver and suffers from a few bugs. Here is an example of what you get when you capture a full page:

<img src="/assets/img/news.com.screengrab2.jpg"/>

Hower if you happen to have a popup come up in front of the window while it is being captured you get this: 

<img src="/assets/img/news.com.screengrab.jpg"/>

Here is an example of a normal screenshot: 

<img src="/assets/img/news.com.screengrab.viewport.jpg"/>

The popup bug seems minor to me so I would say between the two extensions I would pick ScreenGrab because it is completely free.
