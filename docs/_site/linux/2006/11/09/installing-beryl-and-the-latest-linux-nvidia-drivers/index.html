<meta name="description" content="I finally kicked my 64 bit install to the curb and am now running my AMD 64 desktop box in 32 bit mode. I decided that I had had enough of random crashes and having to compile things special every time I wanted something new. Having just upgraded from FC5 to FC6 on a couple other boxes I decided it was worth installing fresh on this box. Once the new install was finished I started looking into the new desktop enhancements that come in FC6 and after a little digging I ended up at the  Beryl project.">

    <p>I finally kicked my 64 bit install to the curb and am now running my AMD 64 desktop box in 32 bit mode. I decided that I had had enough of random crashes and having to compile things special every time I wanted something new. Having just <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/99/upgrade-fc5-to-fc6-with-yum/">upgraded from FC5 to FC6</a> on a couple other boxes I decided it was worth installing fresh on this box. Once the new install was finished I started looking into the new desktop enhancements that come in FC6 and after a little digging I ended up at the  <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/">Beryl</a> project.</p>

<p>For anyone who hasn’t seen it yet Beryl is a fork of Compiz that changes the way your normal X desktop works. It adds different types of OpenGL based effects and works with Xgl, AIGLX, and the latest NVidia binary drivers.</p>

<p>It wasn’t too hard to get Beryl installed. With Fedora Core 6 the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RenderingProject/aiglx">AIGLX</a> extensions you need are included in the base version of XOrg. So I just used this <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2006/10/28/howto-using-beryl-in-fedora-core-6/">Beryl on Fedora Core 6 howto</a> and it just worked. The binary version included in the howto isn’t the latest version so you don’t get some of the cooler new effects. The howto is a great/easy place to start however and will help you figure out if you want to invest the time into compiling the SVN version to get all the latest effects.</p>

<p>Some of the effects that stand out are:</p>

<ul>
<li>3D virtual desktop</li>
<li>Unfocused windows turn translucent</li>
<li>Tabbing through apps shows a screen-shot of each app in its current state</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus if you have an NVidia card and you use the binary drivers you get native support. Just a few days ago you would have had to get the beta drivers from NVidia but they just released the latest 9xxx series drivers that now have the needed support included: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-9629.html">Latest binary NVidia drivers (1.0-9629)</a>.</p>
