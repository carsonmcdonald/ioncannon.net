I like seeing more and more uses of prototype. I'm not sure if the big guys will win out with their UI toolkits (Yahoo UI/GWT) or if it will always feel better to put things together by hand. Either way it is good to understand how this stuff works. This is an <a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2006/06/07/ajax-edit-in-place-with-prototype-version-020/">edit in place</a> example that is similar to what you see on flickr.

I've seen something like this a number of times when I've visited sites. They want your feedback on something or other while you are browsing. It is a little floating plus feedback sign that hangs out in the lower right hand corner. <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/blog/p_ajax_feedback_mechanism.html">Check it out</a>.

Browsing digg I noticed an article on "unobtrusive sidenotes" and found that the idea is pretty cool: The <a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2006/05/introducing_unobtrusive_sideno.php">announcement</a> and <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2006/05/unobtrusive_sidenotes.php">code</a>. They are done with javascript so you can turn them on and off on the fly.
