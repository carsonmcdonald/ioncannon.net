I found a post about <a href="http://blog.thinkphp.de/archives/124-An-alternative-Approach-to-Tagging.html">an alternative approach to tagging</a> today and thought it would be interesting if someone made a wordpress plugin that would use this idea. It seems like it might be a nice alternative to the normal site map that most sites have when there is a lot of information to drill down into.
