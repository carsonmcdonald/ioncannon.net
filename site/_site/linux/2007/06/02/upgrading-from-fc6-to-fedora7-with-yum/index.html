      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">Upgrading from FC6 to Fedora 7 with yum</h1>
    
    <p>Now that Fedora 7 has been release it is time to upgrade from that crusty old Fedora Core 6. Note that they have removed the “Core” from the name so a few things have changed with the paths used in yum. Last year I did a post on how to <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/99/upgrade-fc5-to-fc6-with-yum/">upgrade from FC5 to FC6</a> and this upgrade happened on the first box I used for that.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before you start see the note after these steps about checking for disk labels</li>
  <li>yum update</li>
  <li>yum clean all</li>
  <li>I repeated update and clean all a second time to make sure everything got updated</li>
  <li>I then ran the command:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> rpm -Uhv http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/7/Fedora/x86_64/os/Fedora/fedora-release-7-3.noarch.rpm http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/7/Fedora/x86_64/os/Fedora/fedora-release-notes-7.0.0-1.noarch.rpm
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>I then found that I had to move fedora-development.repo and fedora-updates.repo out of /etc/yum.repos.d/ and replace them with fedora-development.repo.rpmnew and fedora-updates.repo.rpmnew. I also needed to remove a custom repo I had but no longer used so I didn’t take time to figure out why it needed to be removed.</li>
  <li>I then did a yum -y update and waited</li>
  <li>After a good wait another X server was started so you may think about not doing the update while running under X. Luckily it was able to start on another console so all was ok. Now it was time for a reboot.</li>
  <li>After the reboot I had to fix up some NVidia issues but overall it looks like it upgraded without a problem</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes on disk labels:</p>

<p>There are a few things listed in the release notes under <a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f7/en_US/sn-Installer.html#Upgrade-Related-Issues">Upgrade Related Issues</a>.</p>

<p>The first was to make sure all your drives have labels. You can do this by running the command “/sbin/blkid” and then checking that each line that is not part of the LVM system has a LABEL entry. If you need to add a label to a drive use the “/sbin/e2label” command and then edit your /etc/fstab to use the label on boot instead of the device.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>LABEL=/boot             /boot                   ext3    defaults        1 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You don’t need to label LVM drives since the LVM keeps track of the drives it uses on its own. The only drive I had on a stock install that wasn’t under the LVM was /boot and it had a label already.</p>

<p>After you upgrade they sugest running the following command and then upgrading anything that has a date before the upgrade date:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rpm -qa --last &gt; RPMS_by_Install_Time.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
